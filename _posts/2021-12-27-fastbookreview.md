> If you can't explain it in simple terms, then you don't understand it


This quote is something that we might have come across a lot of times. But how many of us have taken it seriously? 

Well, the team at fastai has taken it seriously. They have created a deep learning course & an accompanying book that uses simple terms to demistify some of the most complex topics in the field. I read the book version, which is called "Deep learning for Coders" a.k.a the fastbook.

I was pleasantly surprised by the book as it not only teaches the concepts in deep learning but also gives ideas, perspectives and a little nudge to even contribute back to the community. The best part is that all this is coming from an expert team at fastai led by the highly respected Dr.Jeremy Howard.


The book itself is broadly divided into 4 parts:
1. Practical deep learning
2. Deep learning applications
3. Foundations of deep learning
4. Deep learning from scratch

If you closely look at the flow of the structure above, it directly goes into practical and application based deep learning. Only then the foundations are taught. Why is it? Well, it is called the **top-down learning approach**. I found it to be refreshing as most my education was built on a bottom-up approach where I first learned the theory & math behind the models and then moved to build the ML model. Here by allowing us to start from an application oriented persepctive, we can peel the layers of the framework by going deeper and deeper where we learn the nuts & bolts of how things work from scratch.


All of this is made even better by the fantastic community built around the fastai framework and the book. To give a peek of the powerful community, I am mentioning (in no particular order) some fastai community leaders and their contribution to enhancing the learning experience:

* Aman Arora and W&B team - [The fastbook reading group](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEHdlrBwa7mKFaHX9tH86b93) A playlist that gives walk-through of the key chapters in the book in a lecture-like format
* Zachary Mueller - [A Walk with FastAI](https://walkwithfastai.com) A series of lecturers & notebooks which explores the fastai framework beyond the book by acting as a recipe book on steroids
* Radek Osmulski - [AI Quiz](https://aiquizzes.com) A website of quiz materials that cover the end-of-chapter questions in the fastbook by using a spaced repetition approach

These are just the ones that I have come across while reading the book. There are numerous community members who have contributed their time and effort to make the fastbook more valauable and arguably the best book on deep learning.

To summarise everything in a couple of sentences - **If I had to learn deep learning again, then the fastbook is the only material that I would learn it from. In fact going forward I have a few deep learning courses and books in my bucket list for 2022, but I have a strong feeling that none of them will come close to the value offered by the fastbook.**

Some of my kaggle notebooks that I produced while reading the fastbook includes:
1. [Blood Cell Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/anirudhg15/bloodcell-mixedprecision-train-lrfinder-w-fastai)
2. [Casava Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/anirudhg15/cassava-classification-w-fastai)
3. [Pet Popularity Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/anirudhg15/pawpular-competition-w-fastai-lb-18-0)

Also, did I mention that the entire book is freely available as executable jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). It cannot get better than this!

*Thanks for reading the post. I hope it was of some help to you. If you liked the work, kindly consider sharing the article. Cheers, stay safe and enjoy a happy 2022!*
