# My learning paradigm


> Long term consistency trumps short term intensity - Bruce Lee


This quote has formed the basis of my learning ever since my undergraduate days. However, it does not convey the full story here. Its because keeping up the motivation to learn in the long-term can be tough. Also, what is even more difficult is to remember a concept or a technique that you learnt 6-months ago. 

Why am I saying all this?

Good question! I am here to share my **learning paradigm** that helps me keep motivation and memory in order to achieve long-term consistency in learning. There a few things which I follow :

**1. The Solution approach**

**2. Spaced Repetition**

## The Solution approach

It is easy to loose motivation when you don't work towards a target. For me, a target is a solution that can help solve an issue or make life easy for anyone who is using it. 

Therefore, I follow these 2 steps:
1. Define the final solution that I want to create
2. Work backwards to figure out the steps that can enable me to build the best possible solution, given the resources

With this solution-based approach, I now have a target to work towards. In that process, I tend go out of my way to learn new tools and techniques to make my solution possible.

This appraoch helps keep up my motivation while also allowing me to get more learning out of the project than I originally intended to.


## Spaced Repetition

It is human nature to forget things that we don't use in our day-to-day life. Do I still remember my 12th grade physics concepts? Ofcourse not. Its because physics is not my area of study and as a result I never had the chance to use the learnings in my day-to-day work. 

So getting a certificate on something but not using the learnings from it for a long-time means you forget all the knowledge you gained. Also in the that time, there can be updates or even groundup overhaul which makes your re-learning that much more difficult.

Therefore, I follow spaced repetition. That is:
1. I learn a concept by taking extensive notes about it
2. Then after a few months, I either re-read those notes or parts of the original material

With this spaced repetition, after a few iterations, the learning gets drilled into my brain that I almost always have everything at the top of my head. This makes the subsequent work and building on my existing knowledge as easy as riding a bike.


**By using these 2 paradigms, I keep the long-term consistency in my learning journey.**
