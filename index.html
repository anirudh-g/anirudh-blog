Hello and welcome to my portfolio site and blog.

**I am Anirudh Gokulaprasad, a Data Scientist with 1+ years of industry experience in building Data, Analytics & Machine learning 
solutions in BFSI and Life Science domains.**

My area of interest broadly includes Computer Vision, NLP & Audio based AI applications. I am intrigued by the use of Explainable 
AI and its impact in business-critical and life-critical scenarios. I advocate for simplistic, readable & highly maintainable code.

*My long-term vision is to develop my skills in order to conceptualise, architect and drive end-to-end AI products and solutions at scale.*
